    <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken.</p>
    <p>This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken.</p>
    <p>Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour</strong>: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>
        <li><strong>Panko</strong>: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken, then dredge in flour.</li>
        <li>Coat each breast in egg, then press into the Panko.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken katsu until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
